## Currently

Fraunhofer Austria Research GmbH, Austria

## Summary

Coming from a long lasting C++ programming career mainly in computer graphics and virtual reality applications my main focus now lies in the management, design and development of full-stack web applications. I'm interested in creating maintainable products and have a strong sense for tooling. Mentoring and consulting play an important role in my daily work.

## Projects

### [DURAARK (open source)](http://duraark.eu)

DURAARK is a project funded by the European Union to support the long-term archival of architectural data. We provide a microservice-based system for the processing and long-term archival of architectural data via a REST-API and a graphical web application. See the [project web page](http://duraark.eu) for more information, the [demo page](http://workbench.duraark.eu) for the web application and our [Github page](https://github.com/duraark/duraark-system) for the source code.

*I was leading the work package responsible for integrating the software prototypes delivered by our six project partners into a coherent web application and REST-API. The main technologies used were NodeJS/SailsJS (microservices), EmberJS, and Docker.*


### [V-MANIP (open source)](http://demo.v-manip.eox.at/about.html)

V-MANIP was a project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). We developed a multi-dimensional web application for earth observation data collected by ESA satellites. See the [demo page](http://demo.v-manip.eox.at) for the resulting web application and the [Github page](https://github.com/v-manip/WebClient-Framework) for the source code.

*I was designing and developing the application framework and developed two 3D viewer components (terrain viewer, virtual globe viewer). The main technologies used were BackboneJS, Python, X3DOM/WebGL, D3, and Vagrant.*

### [MOVING](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/b_VirtualEngineering/moving.html)

The MOVING project developed an immersive virtual reality environment within a [CAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment) to test pedestrian guidance systems in an realistic virtual environment. Testing the guidance system directly within a realistic 3D model (i.e. the model of the new Vienna main train station) helps to optimize the system at low cost already in the planning phase. A in-depth description of the project can be found [here](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/b_VirtualEngineering/moving.html).

*I was designing and developing a graphics engine for clustered rendering of 3D stereo scenes and actors. The main technologies used were C++, [OpenSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSG) and CMake.*

### [mPed+](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/a_VisualDecisionSupport/mped.html)

In mPed+ we developed a system to visualize pedestrian flows within subway stations. The goal was to simulate default and emergency events in a subway station to help building designers to create the station in an optimized way. A in-depth description of the project can be found [here](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/a_VisualDecisionSupport/mped.html).
  
*I was developing and integrating parametric models (e.g., escalators, train tracks) based on the [Generative Modeling Language (GML)](http://www.generative-modeling.org/). The main technologies used were C++, GML and CMake.*

## Personal Interests

To keep my work and life in balance I enjoy rock climbing and like to photograph.
