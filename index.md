Freelancing; available for hire

## Summary

I am a passionate application and API architect and developer. In the last years I have been working in cross-functional teams on all levels, from management positions to software design and development work. I strive to create maintainable products and have a strong sense for tooling and automation. The mentoring of junior developers is also an important part of my work.

## Projects

### [DURAARK](http://duraark.eu), [(open source)](http://github.com/DURAARK)

DURAARK is a project funded by the European Union to support the long-term archival of architectural data. We provide a microservice-based system for the processing and long-term archival of architectural data via REST-APIs and a graphical web application (demonstrator). See the [project web page](http://duraark.eu) for more information, the [demo page](http://workbench.duraark.eu) for the demonstrator and our [Github page](https://github.com/duraark/duraark-system) for the source code.

*I was leading the work package responsible for integrating the software prototypes delivered by six project partners into a coherent web application and REST-API layer. Software Architecture and reusable and maintainable component/API design were the main aspects of the work. The main technologies used were NodeJS/SailsJS (backend), EmberJS (frontend), and Docker (devops).*

### [V-MANIP](http://demo.v-manip.eox.at/about.html), [(open source)](http://github.com/v-manip)

V-MANIP was a project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). We developed a web application for searching earth observation data collected by ESA satellites. The project provides multiple 2D and 3D viewer for analyzing earth observation by data scientists. See the [demo page](http://demo.v-manip.eox.at) for the resulting web application and the [Github page](https://github.com/v-manip/WebClient-Framework) for the source code.

*I was co-designing and developing the application framework, as well as the 3D viewer components (terrain viewer, virtual globe viewer). Focus of the work were a modular software design and the utilization of 3D web technologies. The main technologies used were BackboneJS/X3DOM/WebGL/D3 (frontend), Python (backend), and Vagrant (devops).*

### [MOVING](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/b_VirtualEngineering/moving.html)

The MOVING project developed an immersive virtual reality environment within a [CAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment) to test pedestrian guidance systems in an realistic virtual environment. Testing the guidance system directly within a realistic 3D model (i.e. the model of the new Vienna main train station) helped to optimize the system at low cost already in the planning phase. A in-depth description of the project can be found [here](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/b_VirtualEngineering/moving.html).

*I was designing and developing a graphics engine for clustered rendering of 3D stereo scenes and actors. The main technologies used were C++, [OpenSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSG) and CMake for reproducable development environments.*

### [mPed+](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/a_VisualDecisionSupport/mped.html)

In mPed+ a system to visualize pedestrian flows within subway stations was developed. The goal was to simulate default and emergency events in a subway station to help building designers to create the station in an optimized way. A in-depth description of the project can be found [here](http://www.fraunhofer.at/en/visual-computing/projects/a_VisualDecisionSupport/mped.html).

*I was developing and integrating parametric models (e.g., escalators, train tracks) based on the [Generative Modeling Language (GML)](http://www.generative-modeling.org/). The main technologies used were C++, GML and CMake.*

## Personal Interests

I enjoy rock climbing and like to photograph.
